Given a string path consisting of 'U' and 'D' characters for upward and downward steps, respectively, we want to count the number of valleys traversed. A valley
has been defined as a sequence of steps occurring below sea level. We can count the number of valleys according to the following conditions: if a step has the
value 'U' and the sea level is 0 units, then a valley has been traversed. The pseudocode looks something like this:

function solution(int steps, string path):
  valleys = 0
  lvl = 0
  for character in path:
    if character is 'U':
      level++
    if character is 'D':
      level--
    if character is 'U' and lvl is 0:
      valleys++
  return valleys
